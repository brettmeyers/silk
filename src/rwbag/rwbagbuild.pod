=head1 NAME

B<rwbagbuild> - Create a binary Bag from non-flow data.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  rwbagbuild { --set-input=SETFILE | --bag-input=TEXTFILE }
        [--delimiter=C] [--default-count=DEFAULTCOUNT]
        [--key-type=FIELD_TYPE] [--counter-type=FIELD_TYPE]
        [--note-add=TEXT] [--note-file-add=FILE]
        [--compression-method=COMP_METHOD] [--output-path=OUTPUTFILE]

  rwbagbuild --help

  rwbagbuild --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rwbagbuild> builds a binary Bag file from an IPset file or from
textual input.

When creating a Bag from an IPset, the value associated with each IP
address is the value given by the B<--default-count> switch, or 1 if
the switch isn't provided.

The textual input read from the argument to the B<--bag-input> switch
is processed a line at a time.  Comments begin with a 'B<#>'-character
and continue to the end of the line; they are stripped from each line.
Any line that is blank or contains only whitespace is ignored.  All
other lines must contain a valid key or key-count pair; whitespace
around the key and count is ignored.

If the delimiter character (specified by the B<--delimiter> switch and
having pipe ('B<|>') as its default) is not present, the line must
contain only an IP address or an integer key.  If the delimiter is
present, the line must contain an IP address or integer key before the
delimiter and an integer count after the delimiter.  These lines may
have a second delimiter after the integer count; the second delimiter
and any text to the right of it are ignored.

When the B<--default-count> switch is specified, its value will used
as the count for each key, and the count value parsed from each line,
if any, is ignored.  Otherwise, the parsed count is used, or 1 is used
as the count if no delimiter was present.

For each key-count pair, the key will be inserted into Bag with its
count or, if the key is already present in the Bag, its total count
will be incremented by the count from this line.

The IP address or integer key must be expressed in one of the
following formats.  B<rwbagbuild> complains if the key field contains
a mixture of IPv6 addresses and integer values.

=over 4

=item *

Dotted decimal---all 4 octets are required:

 10.1.2.4

=item *

An unsigned 32-bit integer:

 167838212

=item *

An IPv6 address in canonical form (when SiLK has been compiled with
IPv6 support):

 2001:db8:a:1::2:4
 ::ffff:10.1.2.4

=item *

Any of the above with a CIDR designation---for dotted decimal all
four octets are still required:

 10.1.2.4/31
 167838212/31
 2001:db8:a:1::2:4/127
 ::ffff:10.1.2.4/31

=item *

SiLK IP wildcard notation.  A SiLK IP Wildcard can represent multiple
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  An IP Wildcard contains an IP in its
canonical form, except each part of the IP (where I<part> is an octet
for IPv4 or a hexadectet for IPv6) may be a single value, a range, a
comma separated list of values and ranges, or the letter C<x> to
signify all values for that part of the IP (that is, C<0-255> for
IPv4).  You may not specify a CIDR suffix when using the IP Wildcard
notation.

 10.x.1-2.4,5
 2001:db8:a:x::1-2:4,5

=back

If an IP address or count cannot be parsed, or if a line contains a
delimiter character but no count, B<rwbagbuild> prints an error and
exits.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique or is an
exact match for an option.  A parameter to an option may be specified
as B<--arg>=I<param> or S<B<--arg> I<param>>, though the first form is
required for options that take optional parameters.

The following two switches control the type of input; one and
only one must be provided:

=over 4

=item B<--set-input>=I<SETFILE>

Create a Bag from an IPset.  I<SETFILE> is a filename, a named pipe,
or the keyword C<stdin> or C<-> to read the IPset from the standard
input.  Counts have a volume of 1 when the B<--default-count> switch
is not specified.  (IPsets are typically created by B<rwset(1)> or
B<rwsetbuild(1)>.)

=item B<--bag-input>=I<TEXTFILE>

Create a Bag from a delimited text file.  I<TEXTFILE> is a filename, a
named pipe, or the keyword C<stdin> or C<-> to read the text from the
standard input.  See the L</DESCRIPTION> section for the syntax of the
I<TEXTFILE>.

=item B<--delimiter>=I<C>

The delimiter to expect between each key-count pair of the I<TEXTFILE>
read by the B<--bag-input> switch.  The delimiter is ignored if the
B<--set-input> switch is specified.  Since 'B<#>' is used to denote
comments and newline is used to used to denote records, neither is a
valid delimiter character.

=item B<--default-count>=I<DEFAULTCOUNT>

Override the counts of all values in the input text or IPset with the
value of I<DEFAULTCOUNT>.  I<DEFAULTCOUNT> must be a positive integer.

=item B<--key-type>=I<FIELD_TYPE>

Write a entry into the header of the Bag file that specifies the key
contains I<FIELD_TYPE> values.  When this switch is not specified, the
key type of the Bag is set to C<custom>.  The I<FIELD_TYPE> is case
insensitive.  The supported I<FIELD_TYPE>s are:

=over 4

=item sIPv4

source IP address, IPv4 only

=item dIPv4

destination IP address, IPv4 only

=item sPort

=item dPort

=item protocol

=item packets

=item bytes

=item flags

=item class

class of the sensor

=item type

upper byte and the code is in the lower byte

=item sIPv6

=item any-snmp

a generic SNMP value

=item any-time

a generic time value, in seconds resolution

=item custom

=back

=item B<--counter-type>=I<FIELD_TYPE>

Write a entry into the header of the Bag file that specifies the
counter contains I<FIELD_TYPE> values.  When this switch is not
specified, the counter type of the Bag is set to C<custom>.  The
supported I<FIELD_TYPE>s are the same as those for the key.

=item B<--note-add>=I<TEXT>

Add the specified I<TEXT> to the header of the output file as an
annotation.  This switch may be repeated to add multiple annotations
to a file.  To view the annotations, use the B<rwfileinfo(1)> tool.

=item B<--note-file-add>=I<FILENAME>

Open I<FILENAME> and add the contents of that file to the header of
the output file as an annotation.    This switch may be repeated to
add multiple annotations.  Currently the application makes no effort
to ensure that I<FILENAME> contains text; be careful that you do not
attempt to add a SiLK data file as an annotation.

=item B<--compression-method>=I<COMP_METHOD>

Specify how to compress the output.  When this switch is not given,
output to the standard output or to named pipes is not compressed, and
output to files is compressed using the default chosen when SiLK was
compiled.  The valid values for I<COMP_METHOD> are determined by which
external libraries were found when SiLK was compiled.  To see the
available compression methods and the default method, use the
B<--help> or B<--version> switch.  SiLK can support the following
I<COMP_METHOD> values when the required libraries are available.

=over 4

=item none

Do not compress the output using an external library.

=item zlib

Use the B<zlib(3)> library for compressing the output, and always
compress the output regardless of the destination.  Using zlib
produces the smallest output files at the cost of speed.

=item lzo1x

Use the I<lzo1x> algorithm from the LZO real time compression library
for compression, and always compress the output regardless of the
destination.  This compression provides good compression with less
memory and CPU overhead.

=item best

Use lzo1x if available, otherwise use zlib.  Only compress the output
when writing to a file.

=back

=item B<--output-path>=I<OUTPUTFILE>

Redirect output to I<OUTPUTFILE>.  I<OUTPUTFILE> is a filename, a
named pipe, or the keyword C<stdout> or C<-> to write the bag to the
standard output.

=item B<--help>

Print the available options and exit.

=item B<--version>

Print the version number and information about how SiLK was
configured, then exit the application.

=head1 EXAMPLES

In the following examples, the dollar sign (C<$>) represents the shell
prompt.  The text after the dollar sign represents the command line.
Lines have been wrapped for improved readability, and the back slash
(C<\>) is used to indicate a wrapped line.

Assume the file F<mybag.txt> contains the following (ignore leading
whitespace and assume every line ends with a newline):

 192.168.0.1|5
 192.168.0.2|500
 192.168.0.3|3
 192.168.0.4|14
 192.168.0.5|5

To build a bag with it:

 $ rwbagbuild --bag-input=mybag.txt > mybag.bag

To create a Bag of protocol data from the text file F<myproto.txt>:

   1|      4|
   6|    138|
  17|    131|

use

 $ rwbagbuild --bag-input=myproto.txt > myproto.bag

Given the IP set F<myset.set>, create a bag where every entry in the
set has a count of 3:

 $ rwbagbuild --set-input=myset.set --default-count=3 \
        --out=mybag2.bag


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item SILK_CLOBBER

The SiLK tools normally refuse to overwrite existing files.  Setting
SILK_CLOBBER to a non-empty value removes this restriction.
