**  rwstats.c
**
**  Implementation of the rwstats suite application.
**
**  Reads packed files or reads the output from rwfilter and can
**  compute a battery of characterizations and statistics:
**
**  -- Top N or Bottom N SIPs with counts; count of unique SIPs
**  -- Top N or Bottom N DIPs with counts; count of unique DIPs
**  -- Top N or Bottom N SIP/DIP pairs with counts; count of unique
**     SIP/DIP pairs (for a limited number of records)
**  -- Top N or Bottom N Src Ports with counts; count of unique Src Ports
**  -- Top N or Bottom N Dest Ports with counts; count of unique Dest Ports
**  -- Top N or Bottom N Protocols with counts; count of unique protocols
**  -- For more continuous variables (bytes, packets, bytes/packet)
**     provide statistics such as min, max, quartiles, and intervals
**
**  Instead of specifying a Top N or Bottom N as an absolute number N,
**  the user may specify a cutoff threshold.  In this case, the Top N
**  or Bottom N required to print all counts meeting the threshold is
**  computed by the application.
**
**  Instead of specifying the threshold as an absolute count, the user
**  may specify the threshold as percentage of all input records.  For
**  this case, the absolute threshold is calculated and then that is
**  used to calculate the Top N or Bottom N.
**
**  The application will only do calculations and produce output when
**  asked to do so.  At least one argument is required to tell the
**  application what to do.
**
**  Ideas for expansion
**  -- Similarly for other variables, e.g., country code.
**  -- Output each type of data to its own file
**  -- Save intermediate data in files for faster reprocessing by this
**     application
**  -- Save intermediate data in files for processing by other
**     applications
**
*/

/*
**  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
**
**  For each input type (source ip, dest ip, source port, proto, etc),
**  there are two globals: limit_<type> contains the value the user
**  entered for the input type, and wanted_stat_<type> is a member
**  of the wanted_stat_type and says what the limit_<type> value
**  represents---e.g., the Top N, the bottom threshold percentage, etc.
**
**  The application takes input (either from stdin or as files on
**  command line) and calls processFile() on each.  A count of each
**  unique source IP addresses is stored in the IpCounter hash table
**  counter_src_ip; Destinations IPs in counter_dest_ip; data for
**  flow between a Source IP and Destination IP pair are stored in
**  counter_pair_ip.
**
**  Since there are relatively few ports and protocols, two
**  65536-elements arrays, src_port_array and dest_port_array are
**  used to store a count of the records for each source and
**  destination port, respectively, and a 256-element array,
**  proto_array, is used to store a count of each protocol.
**
**  Minima, maxima, quartile, and interval data are stored for each of
**  bytes, packets, and bytes-per-packet for all flows--regardless of
**  protocol--and detailed for a limited number (RWSTATS_NUM_PROTO-1)
**  of protocols..  The minima and maxima are each stored in arrays
**  for each of bytes, packets, bpp.  For example bytes_min[0]
**  stores the smallest byte count regardless of protocol (ie, over
**  all protocols), and pkts_max[1] stores the largest packet count
**  for the first protocol the user specified.  The mapping from
**  protocol to array index is given by proto_to_stats_idx[], where
**  the index into proto_to_stats_idx[] returns an integer that is
**  the index into bytes_min[].  Data for the intervals is stored in
**  two dimensional arrays, where the first dimension is the same as
**  for the minima and maxima, and the second dimension is the number
**  of intervals, NUM_INTERVALS.
**
**  Once data is collected, it is processed.
**
**  For the IPs, the user is interested the number of unique IPs and
**  the IPs with the topN counts (things are similar for the bottomN,
**  but we use topN in this dicussion to keep things more clear).  In
**  the printTopIps() function, an array with 2*topN elements is
**  created and passed to calcTopIps(); that array will be the result
**  array and it will hold the topN IpAddr and IpCount pairs in sorted
**  order.  In calcTopIps(), a working array of 2*topN elements and a
**  Heap data structure with topN nodes are created.  The topN
**  IpCounts seen are stored as IpCount/IpAddr pairs in the
**  2*topN-element array (but not in sorted order), and the heap
**  stores pointers into that array with the lowest IpCount at the
**  root of the heap.  As the function iterates over the hash table,
**  it compares the IpCount of the current hash-table element with the
**  IpCount at the root of the heap.  When the IpCount of the
**  hash-table element is larger, the root of the heap is removed, the
**  IpCount/IpAddr pair pointed to by the former heap-root is removed
**  from the 2*topN-element array and replaced with the new
**  IpCount/IpAddr pair, and finally a new node is added to the heap
**  that points to the new IpCount/IpAddr pair.  This continues until
**  all hash-table entries are processed.  To get the list of topN IPs
**  from highest to lowest, calcTopIps() removes elements from the
**  heap and stores them in the result array from position N-1 to
**  position 0.
**
**  Finding the topN source ports, topN destination ports, and topN
**  protocols are similar to finding the topN IPs, except the ports
**  and protocols are already stored in an array, so pointers directly
**  into the src_port_array, dest_port_array, and proto_array
**  are stored in the heap.  When generating output, the number of the
**  port or protocol is determined by the diffence between the pointer
**  into the *_port_array or proto_array and its start.
**
**  Instead of specifying a topN, the user may specify a cutoff
**  threshold.  In this case, the topN required to print all counts
**  meeting the threshold is computed by looping over the IP
**  hash-table or port/protocol arrays and finding all entries with at
**  least threshold hits.
**
**  The user may specify a percentage threshold instead of an absolute
**  threshold.  Once all records are read, the total record count is
**  multiplied by the percentage threshold to get the absolute
**  threshold cutoff, and that is used to calculate the topN as
**  described in the preceeding paragraph.
**
**  For the continuous variables bytes, packets, bpp, most of the work
**  was done while reading the data, so processing is minimal.  Only
**  the quartiles must be calculated.
