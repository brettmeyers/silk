B<rwsetbuild> - Create a binary IPset file from list of IPs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  rwsetbuild [{--ip-ranges | --ip-ranges=DELIM}]
        [--record-version=VERSION] [--invocation-strip]
        [--note-add=TEXT] [--note-file-add=FILENAME]
        [--compression-method=COMP_METHOD]
        [{INPUT_TEXT_FILE | -} [{OUTPUT_SET_FILE | -}]]

  rwsetbuild --help

  rwsetbuild --version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rwsetbuild> creates a binary IPset file from textual input.  The
IPset will be written to the second command line argument if it has
been specified; otherwise the IPset is written to the standard output
if the standard output is not a terminal.  B<rwsetbuild> will not
overwrite an existing file.  The textual input is read from the first
command line argument if it has been specified; otherwise the text is
read from the standard input if the standard input is not a terminal.
A input file name of C<stdin> or C<-> means the standard input; an
output file name of C<stdout> or C<-> means the standard output.
B<rwsetbuild> will read textual IPs from the terminal if the standard
input is explicitly given as the input.  B<rwsetbuild> exits with an
error if the input file cannot be read or the output file cannot be
written.

Comments are ignored in the input file; they begin with the 'B<#>'
symbol and continue to the end of the line.  Whitespace and blank
lines are also ignored.  Otherwise, a line should contain a single IP
addresses unless the B<--ip-ranges> switch is specified, in which case
a line may contain two IP addresses separated by the user-specified
delimiter, which defaults to hyphen (C<->).

B<rwsetbuild> supports IPv4 addresses.  When SiLK has been built with
IPv6 support, B<rwsetbuild> can build an IPset containing IPv6
addresses.  When the input contains a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, the IPv4 addresses are mapped into the ::ffff:0:0/96 block
of IPv6.  When writing the IPset, B<rwsetbuild> will convert the
output to IPv4 if all IPv6 addresses were in the ::ffff:0:0/96 block.
B<rwsetbuild> does not allow the input to contain both integer values
and IPv6 addresses.

Each IP address must be expressed in one of these formats:

=over

=item *

Canonical IPv4 address (i.e., dotted decimal---all 4 octets are
required):

  10.1.2.4

=item *

An unsigned 32-bit integer:

  167838212

=item *

Canonical IPv6 address:

  2001:db8::f00

=item *

Any of the above with a CIDR designation:

  10.1.2.4/31
  167838212/31
  192.168.0.0/16
  2001:db8::/48

=item *

SiLK IP Wildcard: An IP Wildcard can represent multiple IPv4 or IPv6
addresses.  An IP Wildcard contains an IP in its canonical form,
except each part of the IP (where I<part> is an octet for IPv4 or a
hexadectet for IPv6) may be a single value, a range, a comma separated
list of values and ranges, or the letter C<x> to signify all values
for that part of the IP (that is, C<0-255> for IPv4).  You may not
specify a CIDR suffix when using IP Wildcard notation.  IP Wildcard
notation is not supported when the B<--ip-ranges> switch is specified.

  10.x.1-2.4,5
  2001:db8::aaab-ffff,aaaa,0-aaa9

=item *

IP Range: An IPv4 address, an unsigned 32-bit integer, or an IPv6
address to use as the start of the range, a delimiter, and an IPv4
address, an unsigned 32-bit integer, or an IPv6 address to use as the
end of the range.  The default delimiter is the hyphen (C<->), but a
different delimiter may be specified as a parameter to the
B<--ip-ranges> switch.  Whitespace around the IP addresses is ignored.
Only valid when B<--ip-ranges> is specified.

  10.1.2.4-10.1.2.5
  167838212-167838213
  192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255
  2001:db8::f00-2001:db8::fff

=back

If an IP address cannot be parsed, B<rwsetbuild> will exit with an
error.

=head1 OPTIONS

Option names may be abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique or is an
exact match for an option.  A parameter to an option may be specified
as B<--arg>=I<param> or B<--arg> I<param>, though the first form is
required for options that take optional parameters.

=over 4

=item B<--ip-ranges>

=item B<--ip-ranges>=I<DELIM>

Allow the input file to contain ranges of IP addresses.  If I<DELIM>
is not specified, hyphen (C<->) is used as the delimiter.  I<DELIM>
may be the space character.  This method also supports lines that
contain a single IP address (or integer); these lines may have a CIDR
designation.  CIDR designations are not supported on lines that
contain I<DELIM>.  When B<--ip-ranges> is active, SiLK wildcard IP
syntax is not supported.

=item B<--record-version>=I<VERSION>

Specify the format of the IPset records that are written to the
output.  Valid values are 0, 2, 3, and 4.  When the switch is not
provided, the SILK_IPSET_RECORD_VERSION environment variable is
checked for a version.  A I<VERSION> of 2 creates a file compatible
with S<SiLK 2.x>, and it can only be used for IPsets containing IPv4
addresses.  A I<VERSION> of 3 creates a file that can only be read by
S<SiLK 3.0> or later.  A I<VERSION> of 4 creates a file that can only
be read by S<SiLK 3.7> or later.  Version 4 files are smaller than
version 3 files.  The default I<VERSION> is 0, which uses version 2
for IPv4 IPsets and version 3 for IPv6 IPsets.

=item B<--invocation-strip>

Do not record any command line history; that is, do not record the
current command line invocation in the output file.

=item B<--note-add>=I<TEXT>

Add the specified I<TEXT> to the header of the output file as an
annotation.  This switch may be repeated to add multiple annotations
to a file.  To view the annotations, use the B<rwfileinfo(1)> tool.

=item B<--note-file-add>=I<FILENAME>

Open I<FILENAME> and add the contents of that file to the header of
the output file as an annotation.    This switch may be repeated to
add multiple annotations.  Currently the application makes no effort
to ensure that I<FILENAME> contains text; be careful that you do not
attempt to add a SiLK data file as an annotation.

=item B<--compression-method>=I<COMP_METHOD>

Specify how to compress the output.  When this switch is not given,
output to the standard output or to named pipes is not compressed, and
output to files is compressed using the default chosen when SiLK was
compiled.  The valid values for I<COMP_METHOD> are determined by which
external libraries were found when SiLK was compiled.  To see the
available compression methods and the default method, use the
B<--help> or B<--version> switch.  SiLK can support the following
I<COMP_METHOD> values when the required libraries are available.

=over 4

=item none

Do not compress the output using an external library.

=item zlib

Use the B<zlib(3)> library for compressing the output, and always
compress the output regardless of the destination.  Using zlib
produces the smallest output files at the cost of speed.

=item lzo1x

Use the I<lzo1x> algorithm from the LZO real time compression library
for compression, and always compress the output regardless of the
destination.  This compression provides good compression with less
memory and CPU overhead.

=item best

Use lzo1x if available, otherwise use zlib.  Only compress the output
when writing to a file.

=back

=item B<--help>

Print the available options and exit.

=item B<--version>

Print the version number and information about how SiLK was
configured, then exit the application.

=head1 EXAMPLE

In the following examples, the dollar sign (C<$>) represents the shell
prompt.  The text after the dollar sign represents the command line.

=for comment
Lines have been wrapped for improved readability, and the back slash
(C<\>) is used to indicate a wrapped line.

Reading from a file:

  $ echo 10.x.x.x > ten.txt
  $ rwsetbuild ten.txt ten.set

  $ echo 10.0.0.0/8 > ten.txt
  $ rwsetbuild ten.txt ten.set

  $ echo 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 > ten.txt
  $ rwsetbuild --ip-ranges ten.txt ten.set

  $ echo '167772160,184549375' > ten.txt
  $ rwsetbuild --ip-ranges=, ten.txt ten.set

Reading from the standard input:

  $ echo 192.168.x.x | rwsetbuild stdin private.set

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item SILK_IPSET_RECORD_VERSION

This environment variable is used as the value for the
B<--record-version> when that switch is not provided.

=item SILK_CLOBBER

The SiLK tools normally refuse to overwrite existing files.  Setting
SILK_CLOBBER to a non-empty value removes this restriction.

=head1 NOTES

The B<--record-version> switch was added in S<SiLK 3.0>.  Prior to
S<SiLK 3.6>, the only supported arguments for the switch were 2 and 3,
with the default being 3.  As of S<SiLK 3.6>, the default is 0.
Version 4 was added in S<SiLK 3.7>.
